**Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few points:**

1. The data used for demonstration purposes is dummy data created solely for reference. It bears no relation to any actual corporate environments.
2. I'm not an expert in Excel or Python, but I do have some basic knowledge of both from my day-to-day experience.
3. ChatGPT was used to generate the code for each task and then all this code is reviewed, modified and combined as per my requirement to attain the desired result.

Hi All,

I'm Ravi, a Cyber Security Professional with over 6 years of experience in implementing and managing Endpoint Security and Vulnerability Management tools. One of the routine tasks we encounter daily is managing reports generated by these tools. These reports are typically in Excel format, often involving repetitive activities such as:
- Copy and Paste
- Find and Replace
- VLOOKUPs 

I'm one of the individuals tasked with handling large datasets and navigating through multiple sheets to generate the necessary reports. Lately, my focus has been on vulnerability reporting, particularly with data sourced from Qualys. While Qualys provides the essential data, a significant amount of manual data normalization is still required to align it with the context of our customers.

**UseCase**

Relating detections against the Asset CMDB is a common task. Utilizing two files, the Asset CMDB and Detections (both containing dummy data for reference), will be managed through the Python script "Excel Report V1.0".

**What Does the Script Do?**

This initial version of the script aims to accomplish several basic Excel tasks:

1. Take two datasets (Asset CMDB and Detections).
2. Use "IP" as a key to perform a VLOOKUP and return values from the Asset CMDB to the Detections dataset.
3. Merge the changes into a new dataset.
4. Drop unwanted columns from the merged dataset.
5. Perform a "Find and Replace" task based on given old and new values.
6. Fill blank columns in selected columns with a desired value (e.g., "NA" or "No").
7. Apply a datetime format for certain columns.
8. Calculate the age of vulnerabilities based on given conditions.
9. Save the file with a current datestamp.

**NOTE**

I suggest reviewing the comments within the script to gain a clear understanding of what each line of code accomplishes. This will provide insights into the logic and functionality of the script, enhancing comprehension and facilitating any necessary modifications or enhancements.

**How to use the script?**

1. Ensure all files are placed in a folder.
2. Verify that Python is installed on your machine.
3. Load the "Excel Report v1.0.py" file in IDLE (Python) and press F5 to execute the script.
4. While the script serves to illustrate how to automate Excel tasks using Python, it must be modified to suit your specific datasets.
