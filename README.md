Hi All,

I'm Ravi, a Cyber Security Professional with over 6 years of experience in implementing and managing Endpoint Security and Vulnerability Management tools. One of the routine tasks we encounter daily is managing reports generated by these tools. These reports are typically in Excel format, often involving repetitive activities such as:
- Copy and Paste
- Find and Replace
- VLOOKUPs
